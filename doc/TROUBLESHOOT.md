# Memory Leak Troubleshooting

This page describes how to troubleshoot memory leaks. See leak detection guidance [here](DETECT.md).

## Collect callstack

Stacktrace for the object's lifecycle events may help to catch out
the leak's root cause. The lifecycle event will be creation
for not-disposed leaks, and disposal for non-GCed leaks.

By default, the leak tracker does not collect stacktraces, because the collection may
impact performance and memory footprint.

There are options to enable stacktrace collection
for troubleshooting:

1. By passing `stackTraceCollectionConfig`
to `withLeakTracking` or `enableLeakTracking`.

2. Using interactive UI in DevTools > Memory > Leaks.

## Check retaining pathes

Open DevTools > Memory > Leaks, wait for not-GCed leaks to be caught,
and click 'Analyze and Download'.
