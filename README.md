# Memory Leak Tracker

TODO: after merge, replace links with absolute, to make them working on pub.dev

This is a framework for detecting memory issues in Dart and Flutter applications. It enables:

1. [Memory leak auto-detection](doc/DETECT.md) for applications and tests.
2. [Auto-snapshotting](doc/AUTOSNAPSHOT.md) in case of memory overuse
by an application.

Documentation:
1. [Understand leak tracking concepts](doc/CONCEPTS.md)
2. [Troubleshoot memory leaks](doc/TROUBLESHOOT.md)
