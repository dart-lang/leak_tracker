# Memory Leak Tracker

This is a framework for detecting memory issues in Dart and Flutter applications. It enables:

1. [Memory leak auto-detection](documentation/LEAK_TRACKING.md) for applications and tests.
2. [Auto-snapshotting](documentation/AUTOSNAPSHOTTING.md) in case of memory overuse
by an application.
