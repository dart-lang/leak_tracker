# Memory Leak Tracker

This is a framework for detecting memory issues in Dart and Flutter applications. It enables:

1. [Memory leak auto-detection](doc/DETECT.md) for applications and tests.
2. [Auto-snapshotting](doc/AUTOSNAPSHOT.md) in case of memory overuse
by an application.

See memory leak troubleshooting guidance [here](doc/TROUBLESHOOT.md).
