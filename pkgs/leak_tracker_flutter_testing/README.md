## What is leak_tracker_flutter_testing?

`leak_tracker_flutter_testing` is Flutter specific test helpers for [leak_tracker](https://pub.dev/packages/leak_tracker).

They are separated from [leak_tracker_testing](https://pub.dev/packages/leak_tracker_testing) because the last one is pure Flutter
package and should not reference Flutter Framework.
