Coming soon! See https://github.com/flutter/devtools/issues/3951 and https://github.com/flutter/devtools/issues/5606.

## Status: Experimental

**NOTE**: This package is currently experimental and published under the
[labs.dart.dev](https://dart.dev/dart-team-packages) pub publisher in order to
solicit feedback.

For packages in the labs.dart.dev publisher we generally plan to either graduate
the package into a supported publisher (dart.dev, tools.dart.dev) after a period
of feedback and iteration, or discontinue the package. These packages have a
much higher expected rate of API and breaking changes.

Your feedback is valuable and will help us evolve this package. For general
feedback, suggestions, and comments, please file an issue in the
[bug tracker](https://github.com/dart-lang/leak_tracker/issues).

## What is this?

This package enables [memory usage tracking and auto-snapshotting](https://github.com/dart-lang/leak_tracker/blob/main/doc/USAGE.md).

## Usage

Use the function trackMemoryUsage to configure usage events and auto-snapshotting in your Dart or Flutter application.

See [usage tracking guidance](https://github.com/dart-lang/leak_tracker/blob/main/doc/USAGE.md) for more details.
