Coming soon! See https://github.com/flutter/devtools/issues/3951 and https://github.com/flutter/devtools/issues/5606.

## What is this?

This is a framework for detecting memory issues in Dart and Flutter applications.

It enables:

1. [Memory leak auto-detection](https://github.com/dart-lang/leak_tracker/blob/main/doc/DETECT.md) for applications and tests.
2. [Memory usage tracking and auto-snapshotting](https://github.com/dart-lang/leak_tracker/blob/main/doc/USAGE.md).

## Usage

First, [understand leak tracking concepts](https://github.com/dart-lang/leak_tracker/blob/main/doc/CONCEPTS.md).

Use [leak_tracker_flutter_testing](https://github.com/dart-lang/leak_tracker/blob/main/pkgs/leak_tracker_flutter_testing/README.md)
to leak track your flutter tests.

See the [the guidance](https://github.com/dart-lang/leak_tracker/blob/main/doc/TROUBLESHOOT.md) to troubleshoot memory leaks.
