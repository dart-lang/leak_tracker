# Auto Snapshotting

Dart and Flutter applications can be confugured to automatically save
memory heap snapshots to hard drive, in case of memory overuse.
The snapshots can be later analysed in DevTools.

TODO (polina-c): add link to DEvTools help section.

## Lumitations

Enabled for: Dart debug and release modes (that are Flutter
debug and profile modes).

See [Dart build modes](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/issues/4436)
